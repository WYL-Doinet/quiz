## About Lara Quiz

This app is built using some of the best features of Laravel:

- **Query Scopes** – for reusable and clean query logic  
- **Laravel Sanctum** – for API authentication  
- **Inertia.js** – for building modern single-page applications using Vue.js  
- **Laravel Notifications** – for sending alerts and messages  
- **Laravel Events** – for handling application events efficiently  
- **Laravel Mail** – for sending emails with ease  
- **Laravel Pint** – for automatic code style formatting  
- **Real-time Notifications with Pusher** – for instant updates and alerts  
- **GitHub Actions** – for automated testing and code formatting on every push

**Lara Quiz** is a mini quiz application intended for in-house use — for example, within a company or classroom. It includes out-of-the-box features to support multiple quizzes with ease.

## GitHub Actions

Lara Quiz uses **GitHub Actions** to automate testing and code formatting. On every push, the following tasks are run:

- Run Laravel's test suite  
- Run Laravel Pint to check and fix code style issues

You can find the workflow file under `.github/workflows/laravel.yml`.
